Agents as representatives of individual courses have the task of allocating the necessary human and technical resources through negotiation. We define the negotiation protocol and describe autonomous decisions of agents within the prescribed framework. The advantages of the multi-agent approach are a direct resolution of conflicts, strategic versatility of negotiation, and natural representation of some real-life problems.",

        "abstract": "Course timetables are the organizational foundation of a university's educational program. While students and lecturers perceive timetable quality individually according to their preferences, there are also collective criteria derived normatively such as balanced workloads or idle time avoidance. A recent challenge and opportunity in curriculum-based timetabling consists of customizing timetables with respect to individual student preferences and with respect to integrating online courses as part of modern course programs or in reaction to flexibility requirements as posed in pandemic situations. Curricula consisting of (large) lectures and (small) tutorials further open the possibility for optimizing not only the lecture and tutorial plan for all students but also the assignments of individual students to tutorial slots. In this paper, we develop a multi-level planning process for university timetabling: On the tactical level, a lecture and tutorial plan is determined for a set of study programs; on the operational level, individual timetables are generated for each student interlacing the lecture plan through a selection of tutorials from the tutorial plan favoring individual preferences. We utilize this mathematical-programming-based planning process as part of a matheuristic which implements a genetic algorithm in order to improve lecture plans, tutorial plans, and individual timetables so as to find an overall university program with well-balanced timetable performance criteria. Since the evaluation of the fitness function amounts to invoking the entire planning process, we additionally provide a proxy in the form of an artificial neural network metamodel. Computational results exhibit the procedure's capability of generating high quality schedules.",

        "abstract": "Solving the university timetabling problem is crucial as it ensures efficient use of resources, minimises scheduling conflicts, and enhances overall productivity. This paper presents a comprehensive review of university timetabling problems using integer programming algorithms. This study explores various integer programming techniques and their effectiveness in optimising complex scheduling requirements in higher education institutions. We analysed 95 integer programming-based models developed for solving university timetabling problems, covering relevant research from 1990 to 2023. The goal is to provide insights into the evolution of these algorithms and their impact on improving university scheduling. We identify that the implementation rate of models using integer programming is 98\\%, which is much higher than 34\\% implementation rates using metaheuristics algorithms from the existing review. The integer programming models are analysed by the problem types, solutions, tools, and datasets. For three types of timetabling problems including course timetabling, class timetabling, and exam timetabling, we dive deeper into the commercial solvers CPLEX (47), Gurobi (11), Lingo (5), Open Solver (4), C++ GLPK (4), AIMMS (2), GAMS (2), XPRESS (2), CELCAT (1), AMPL (1), and Google OR-Tools CP-SAT (1) and identify that CPLEX is the most frequently used integer programming solver. We explored the uses of machine learning algorithms and the hybrid solutions of combining the integer programming and machine learning algorithms in higher education timetabling solutions. We also identify areas for future work, which includes an emphasis on using integer programming algorithms in other industrial areas, and using machine learning models for university timetabling to allow data-driven solutions.",

        "abstract": "The International Timetabling Competition 2019 (ITC 2019) presents a novel and generalized university timetabling problem composed of traditional class time and room assignment and student sectioning. In this paper, we present a parallelized matheuristic tailored to the ITC 2019 problem. The matheuristic is composed of multiple methods using the graph-based mixed-integer programming (MIP) model defined for the ITC 2019 problem by Holm et al. (A graph-based MIP formulation of the International Timetabling Competition 2019. J Sched, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10951-022-00724-y ). We detail all methods included in the parallelized matheuristic and the collaboration between them. The parallelized matheuristic includes two methods for producing initial solutions and uses a fix-and-optimize matheuristic to improve solutions. Additionally, the method uses the full MIP model to calculate lower bounds. We describe how the methods perform collaboratively through solution sharing, and a diversification scheme invoked when the search stagnates. Furthermore, we explain how we decompose the problem for instances with a large number of students. We evaluate components of the parallelized matheuristic using the 30 benchmark instances of the ITC 2019. The complete parallelized matheuristic performs well, even solving some instances to proven optimality. The presented method is the winning algorithm of the competition, further demonstrating its quality.",

The decision making procedure of ScheduleNet includes: (1) representing the state of a scheduling problem with the agent-task graph, (2) extracting node embeddings for agent and tasks nodes, the important relational information among agents and tasks, by employing the type-aware graph attention (TGA), and (3) computing the assignment probability with the computed node embeddings.

        "abstract": "University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is a significant resource allocation challenge with NP-hard characteristics. As problem sizes increase, finding an optimal solution becomes increasingly complex. To address this, we propose an automated planning method using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which treats UCTP as a series of dynamic decision-making tasks. The RL agent acts as an automated planner, operating in a simulated environment that reflects the complexity and constraints of a university course. It adapts to changes in the timetable by evaluating the outcomes of its actions, continuously refining its strategy to identify and implement the most effective actions. During the explore phase, the agent tests new strategies using a priority-driven reward system and an experience replay mechanism. This approach replays high-value actions, enhancing solution diversity and reducing the search space. In the exploit phase, the agent leverages its accumulated knowledge to apply proven effective strategies. It also incorporates unbiased external evaluations to avoid local optima and ensure global optimization of its strategy. Extensive testing on multiple real-world datasets shows that our automated planning framework consistently outperforms existing methods in various complex scheduling scenarios. This confirms its effectiveness and practicality in meeting diverse scheduling needs.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu\\_Planner",
