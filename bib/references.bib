abstract = {The International Timetabling Competition 2019 (ITC 2019) posed a university timetabling problem involving assigning classes to times and rooms for an entire semester while assigning students to required classes. We propose a new mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation of the problem. The MIP formulation takes advantage of different graph structures in conflict graphs to construct a strong formulation of the constraints. In addition, we introduce a reduction algorithm that removes redundancies from the input data. We show that the reduction algorithm, combined with the graph-based MIP formulation, outperforms the MIP formulated by Holm et al. (A MIP formulation of the International Timetabling Competition 2019 problem, 2020) and thus becomes the new state-of-the-art MIP formulation for the ITC 2019. This paper reports the graph-based MIP formulation, which we used during the ITC 2019, and discusses additional approaches that one can use to strengthen the MIP.},

abstract = {Recently, the XHSTT format for high school timetabling was introduced. It provides a uniform way of modeling problem instances and corresponding solutions. The format supports a wide variety of constraints, and currently 38 real-life instances from 11 different countries are available. Thereby, the XHSTT format serves as a common ground for researchers within this area. This paper describes the first exact method capable of handling an arbitrary instance of the XHSTT format. The method is based on a mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) model, which is solved in two steps with a commercial general-purpose MIP solver. Computational results show that our approach is able to find previously unknown optimal solutions for 2 instances of XHSTT and proves optimality of 4 known solutions. For the instances not solved to optimality, new non-trivial lower bounds were found in 11 cases, and new best known solutions were found in 9 cases. Furthermore, the approach is compared with the finalists of Round 2 of the International Timetabling Competition 2011 and is shown to be competitive with one of the finalists.},

abstract = {University course timetabling belongs to classical problems which have been studied for many years by many researchers. This paper will outline existing research and emphasize new research directions and challenges in this area. It is clear that the organization of international competitions has a high impact on the timetabling research. We intend to discuss the organization of the new International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2019) with the aim to motivate further research on complex university course timetabling problems coming from practice. Our goal is the creation of rich real-world data sets. Thanks to the UniTime timetabling system, we can collect a strong set of data with diverse characteristics which we will discuss in the paper. The key novelty lies in the combination of student sectioning together with standard time and room assignment of events in courses. To make the problems more attractive, we remove some of the less important aspects of the real-life data while retaining the computational complexity of the problems.},

The decision making procedure of ScheduleNet includes: (1) representing the state of a scheduling problem with the agent-task graph, (2) extracting node embeddings for agent and tasks nodes, the important relational information among agents and tasks, by employing the type-aware graph attention (TGA), and (3) computing the assignment probability with the computed node embeddings. We validate the effectiveness of ScheduleNet as a general learning-based scheduler for solving various types of multi-agent scheduling tasks, including multiple salesman traveling problem (mTSP) and job shop scheduling problem (JSP).},

In this paper we describe the High School Timetabling Problem in several countries in order to find a common set of constraints and objectives.

To achieve this we propose a standard data format suitable for different countries and educational systems, defined by an XML schema. The schema and datasets are available online.},

Modeling a timetabling problem as a mixed-integer program is not new. Our contribution rests on a number of innovative features adapted to this problem which allow for a reduction in the number of variables and constraints of the mixed-integer program to manageable levels achieving a reasonable computational performance. The proposed algorithm consists of a first-stage method to obtain an initial feasible solution and a second-stage local search procedure to iteratively improve the solution value, both of which involve the optimization of mixed-integer programming problems.},

This problem is defined on top of previous course timetabling problems in the literature, but introduces several new elements, both in terms of new features like student sectioning and new required and optional elements like distribution constraints. Our approach for solving this problem is based on the simulated annealing metaheuristic and consists of two phases. The first phase focuses on finding a feasible solution, and the second phase attempts to optimize the final score while keeping the solution feasible. Our solver detects local optima and applies gradual penalization to force solutions to new neighborhoods. The solver also detects required constraints which are difficult to satisfy and performs a specialized search on them. These adaptively applied mechanisms allow the solver to find feasible solutions for all problem instances of the competition. Results show that our solver gives good overall results and is competitive against other approaches presented in ITC2019.},

  abstract = {Educational timetabling is an ongoing challenging administrative task that is required in most academic institutions. This is mainly due to a large number of constraints and requirements that have to be satisfied. Educational timetabling problems have been classified as NP-hard problems and can be divided into three types: exam timetabling, course timetabling and high school timetabling. The domain of high school timetabling is not well developed when compared to other fields of educational timetabling such as university exam timetabling and course timetabling. As the evolution of the educational systems are continuous, new challenges often arise, requiring new models and solution methodologies. Over the years, a number of methodologies have been developed to address high school timetabling problems. However, there are no comparative studies or rigorous analysis of these methodologies. This survey paper aims to provide a scientific review of high school timetabling. The paper presents a categorisation of the methodologies conducted in recent years based on chronology, category and application (dataset). We first present comparative studies on the success of proposed methodologies. The components and mechanisms of different methodologies are analysed and compared. We also discuss their performance, advantages, disadvantages and potential for improvement. Methodology wise, a shift of popularity from meta-heuristic to mathematical optimisation is observed in recent years. Another observation is that more researchers are opting for XHSTT formatted datasets as a testbed for their algorithms. Finally, we outline the industrial perspective, trends and future direction in high school timetabling optimisation problems.},

In this work, we developed two algorithms based on the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) metaheuristic. The first one, named Skewed General Variable Neighborhood Search (SGVNS), uses Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) as local search method. The second one, so-called Adaptive VNS, is based on VNS and probabilistically chooses the neighborhoods to do local searches, with the probability being higher for the more successful neighborhoods. The computational experiments show a good adherence of these algorithms for solving the problem, especially comparing them with previous works using the same metaheuristic, as well as with previous published results of the winning algorithm of the International Timetabling Competition of 2011.},
