abstract = { In the paper, we present a new architecture and implementation of a multi-agent system for university timetable generation. Agents as representatives of individual courses have the task of allocating the necessary human and technical resources through negotiation. We define the negotiation protocol and describe autonomous decisions of agents within the prescribed framework. The advantages of the multi-agent approach are a direct resolution of conflicts, strategic versatility of negotiation, and natural representation of some real-life problems. }
