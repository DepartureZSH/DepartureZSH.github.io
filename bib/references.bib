  abstract = { In the paper, we present a new architecture and implementation of a multi-agent system for university timetable generation. Agents as representatives of individual courses have the task of allocating the necessary human and technical resources through negotiation. We define the negotiation protocol and describe autonomous decisions of agents within the prescribed framework. The advantages of the multi-agent approach are a direct resolution of conflicts, strategic versatility of negotiation, and natural representation of some real-life problems. }

We formulate these problems as a semi-MDP with episodic reward (makespan) and learn ScheduleNet, a decentralized decision-making policy that can effectively coordinate multiple agents to complete tasks. The decision making procedure of ScheduleNet includes: (1) representing the state of a scheduling problem with the agent-task graph, (2) extracting node embeddings for agent and tasks nodes, the important relational information among agents and tasks, by employing the type-aware graph attention (TGA), and (3) computing the assignment probability with the computed node embeddings.

In this paper, we present a parallelized matheuristic tailored to the ITC 2019 problem. The matheuristic is composed of multiple methods using the graph-based mixed-integer programming (MIP) model defined for the ITC 2019 problem by Holm et al. (A graph-based MIP formulation of the International Timetabling Competition 2019. J Sched, 2022. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10951-022-00724-y ). We detail all methods included in the parallelized matheuristic and the collaboration between them. The parallelized matheuristic includes two methods for producing initial solutions and uses a fix-and-optimize matheuristic to improve solutions. Additionally, the method uses the full MIP model to calculate lower bounds. We describe how the methods perform collaboratively through solution sharing, and a diversification scheme invoked when the search stagnates. Furthermore, we explain how we decompose the problem for instances with a large number of students. We evaluate components of the parallelized matheuristic using the 30 benchmark instances of the ITC 2019. The complete parallelized matheuristic performs well, even solving some instances to proven optimality. The presented method is the winning algorithm of the competition, further demonstrating its quality.},

  abstract = {Course timetables are the organizational foundation of a university's educational program. While students and lecturers perceive timetable quality individually according to their preferences, there are also collective criteria derived normatively such as balanced workloads or idle time avoidance. A recent challenge and opportunity in curriculum-based timetabling consists of customizing timetables with respect to individual student preferences and with respect to integrating online courses as part of modern course programs or in reaction to flexibility requirements as posed in pandemic situations. Curricula consisting of (large) lectures and (small) tutorials further open the possibility for optimizing not only the lecture and tutorial plan for all students but also the assignments of individual students to tutorial slots. In this paper, we develop a multi-level planning process for university timetabling: On the tactical level, a lecture and tutorial plan is determined for a set of study programs; on the operational level, individual timetables are generated for each student interlacing the lecture plan through a selection of tutorials from the tutorial plan favoring individual preferences. We utilize this mathematical-programming-based planning process as part of a matheuristic which implements a genetic algorithm in order to improve lecture plans, tutorial plans, and individual timetables so as to find an overall university program with well-balanced timetable performance criteria. Since the evaluation of the fitness function amounts to invoking the entire planning process, we additionally provide a proxy in the form of an artificial neural network metamodel. Computational results exhibit the procedure's capability of generating high quality schedules.},

  abstract = {University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) is a significant resource allocation challenge with NP-hard characteristics. As problem sizes increase, finding an optimal solution becomes increasingly complex. To address this, we propose an automated planning method using Reinforcement Learning (RL), which treats UCTP as a series of dynamic decision-making tasks. The RL agent acts as an automated planner, operating in a simulated environment that reflects the complexity and constraints of a university course. It adapts to changes in the timetable by evaluating the outcomes of its actions, continuously refining its strategy to identify and implement the most effective actions. During the explore phase, the agent tests new strategies using a priority-driven reward system and an experience replay mechanism. This approach replays high-value actions, enhancing solution diversity and reducing the search space. In the exploit phase, the agent leverages its accumulated knowledge to apply proven effective strategies. It also incorporates unbiased external evaluations to avoid local optima and ensure global optimization of its strategy. Extensive testing on multiple real-world datasets shows that our automated planning framework consistently outperforms existing methods in various complex scheduling scenarios. This confirms its effectiveness and practicality in meeting diverse scheduling needs.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of university timetabling problems using integer programming algorithms. This study explores various integer programming techniques and their effectiveness in optimising complex scheduling requirements in higher education institutions. We analysed 95 integer programming-based models developed for solving university timetabling problems, covering relevant research from 1990 to 2023. The goal is to provide insights into the evolution of these algorithms and their impact on improving university scheduling. We identify that the implementation rate of models using integer programming is 98\%, which is much higher than 34\% implementation rates using metaheuristics algorithms from the existing review. The integer programming models are analysed by the problem types, solutions, tools, and datasets. For three types of timetabling problems including course timetabling, class timetabling, and exam timetabling, we dive deeper into the commercial solvers CPLEX (47), Gurobi (11), Lingo (5), Open Solver (4), C++ GLPK (4), AIMMS (2), GAMS (2), XPRESS (2), CELCAT (1), AMPL (1), and Google OR-Tools CP-SAT (1) and identify that CPLEX is the most frequently used integer programming solver. We explored the uses of machine learning algorithms and the hybrid solutions of combining the integer programming and machine learning algorithms in higher education timetabling solutions. We also identify areas for future work, which includes an emphasis on using integer programming algorithms in other industrial areas, and using machine learning models for university timetabling to allow data-driven solutions.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: (1) Customized Generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states, and (2) Intelligent Optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multi-agent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. Additionally, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based five-dimensional evaluation module encompassing clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Zc0812/Edu\_Planner},

abstract = {The timetabling problem, a well-known NP-Hard optimization challenge, spans multiple domains such as education, healthcare, sports, and transportation. Due to its computational complexity, heuristic methods have become the dominant method for solving these problems. However, a lack of consistent comparisons across studies has led to difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of these algorithms. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of 64 studies published between 2012 and 2022, focusing on timetabling algorithms and their performance on established benchmarks. The algorithms are categorized into metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristics, and hyper-heuristics, with their efficacy evaluated across six major benchmarks. The analysis highlights the superiority of single-solution-based metaheuristics, with Simulated Annealing emerging as the most effective algorithm, particularly for educational timetabling problems. Additionally, the challenge of developing generic algorithms capable of performing across different timetabling problem domains is addressed. Despite advances in the field, cross-domain adaptability remains a critical area for further exploration. This survey serves as a guide for future research, providing insights into algorithmic strategies that can enhance the efficiency and generalizability of solutions for timetabling problems.},

Given the myriad of solution methodologies explored across diverse exam timetabling problems and constraints, both in studied benchmark datasets and real-life cases over the last decade, it is imperative to undertake a comprehensive survey. This survey paper aims to comprehensively describe the exam timetabling problem (ETP), including its variants, constraints, and benchmark dataset. We look at different methods to solve ETP problems from 2012 to 2023. These methods include mathematical optimization, heuristics, metaheuristics, hyper-heuristics, hybrid approaches, and matheuristics. Finally, we discuss the review findings and potential research directions. By doing so, we hope to facilitate a deeper understanding of ETP and offer valuable insights for future research.},

MABC could satisfy the hard constraints of the problem for all datasets of the ITC-2007 track 3, a benchmark dataset for the CB-CTT. The penalty of the achieved solutions by MABC is comparable to the related work in the literature that used the ABC for solving the CB-CTT.},

abstract = {Abstract This study deals with the school timetabling problem for the case of Greek high schools. At first, the problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Programming problem for ten instances referring to Greek high schools. Then, the problem is coded using the MathProg programming language. Two different linear programming solvers are employed, Gurobi and CPLEX, to solve the problem for the instances at hand. Two methodologies are proposed. The first one deals with the problem utilising a model that includes all hard and soft constraints, called “monolithic” model, while the second one is based on a decomposition of the problem to six sub-problems. It should be stated that Gurobi and CPLEX did not produced satisfactory results when the monolithic model was the case. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the second proposed methodology, as optimal solutions or new lower bounds were found. In addition, the results produced by Mixed Integer Programming are compared with the best so far published results, obtained by two Nature Inspired algorithms namely Particle Swarm Optimization and Cat Swarm Optimization.},

We also develop a principled instance generator, in order to expand the set of available instances. We perform an experimental analysis and we compare our solvers among themselves, using a testbed composed of both real-world and artificial instances. Even though there is no dominant method, the outcome is that Integer Programming gives the best average results, with Local Search being second, and Constraint Programming last on our testbed. All data is available on the web for verification and future comparisons.},

This paper will outline existing research and emphasize new research directions and challenges in this area. It is clear that the organization of international competitions has a high impact on the timetabling research. We intend to discuss the organization of the new International Timetabling Competition (ITC 2019) with the aim to motivate further research on complex university course timetabling problems coming from practice. Our goal is the creation of rich real-world data sets. Thanks to the UniTime timetabling system, we can collect a strong set of data with diverse characteristics which we will discuss in the paper. The key novelty lies in the combination of student sectioning together with standard time and room assignment of events in courses. To make the problems more attractive, we remove some of the less important aspects of the real-life data while retaining the computational complexity of the problems.},

Hence, this paper presents a novel solution approach for solving school timetabling problem which characterizes the problem-setting in the timetabling problem of the high school system in Nigeria. We developed a mixed integer linear programming model and meta-heuristic method Enhanced Simulated Annealing (ESA) algorithm. Our method Original Research Article Odeniyi et al.; AJRCOS, 5(3): 21-38, 2020; Article no.AJRCOS.55744 22 incorporates specific features of Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in order to solve the school timetabling problem. Both our solution approach and SA approach were implemented using Matrix Laboratory 8.6 software. In order to validate and demonstrate the performance of the developed solution approach, it was tested with the highly constrained school timetabling datasets provided by a Nigerian high school using constraints violation, simulation time and solution cost as evaluation metrics. Our developed solution approach is able to find optimal solution as it satisfied all the specified hard and soft constraints with average simulation time of 37.91 and 42.16 seconds and solution cost of 17.03 and 18.99, respectively, for JSS and SSS to the problem instance. A comparison with results obtained with SA approach shows that the developed solution approach produced optimal solution in smaller simulation time and solution cost, and has a great potential to solve school timetabling problems with satisfactory results. The developed ESA algorithm can be used for solving other related optimization problems.},

abstract = {In this contribution a comparative study of modern heuristics on the school timetabling problem is presented. More precisely, we investigate the application of two population-based algorithms, namely a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and an Artificial Fish Swarm (AFS), on the high school timetabling problem. In order to demonstrate their efficiency and performance, experiments with real-world input data have been performed. Both algorithms proposed manage to create feasible and efficient high school timetables, thus fulfilling adequately the timetabling needs of the respective high schools. Computational results demonstrate that both algorithms manage to reach efficient solutions, most of the times better than existing approaches applied to the same school timetabling input instances using the same evaluation criteria.},

abstract = {The timetabling problem is common to academic institutions such as schools, colleges or universities. It is a very hard combinatorial optimisation problem which attracts the interest of many researchers. The university course timetabling problem (UCTTP) is difficult to address due to the size of the problem and several challenging hard and soft constraints. Over the years, various methodologies were proposed to solve UCTTP. The purpose of this survey paper is to provide the most recent scientific review of the methodologies applied to UCTTP. The paper unveils a classification of methodologies proposed in recent years based on chronology and datasets used. Perspectives, trends, challenges and opportunities in UCTTP are also presented. It is observed that meta-heuristic approaches are popular among researchers. This is followed closely by hybrid methodologies. Hyper-heuristic approaches are also able to produce effective results. Another observation is that the state-of-art methodologies in the scientific literature are not fully utilised in a real-world environment perhaps due to the limited flexibility of these methodologies.},

abstract = {Educational timetabling is an ongoing challenging administrative task that is required in most academic institutions. This is mainly due to a large number of constraints and requirements that have to be satisfied. Educational timetabling problems have been classified as NP-hard problems and can be divided into three types: exam timetabling, course timetabling and high school timetabling. The domain of high school timetabling is not well developed when compared to other fields of educational timetabling such as university exam timetabling and course timetabling. As the evolution of the educational systems are continuous, new challenges often arise, requiring new models and solution methodologies. Over the years, a number of methodologies have been developed to address high school timetabling problems. However, there are no comparative studies or rigorous analysis of these methodologies. This survey paper aims to provide a scientific review of high school timetabling. The paper presents a categorisation of the methodologies conducted in recent years based on chronology, category and application (dataset). We first present comparative studies on the success of proposed methodologies. The components and mechanisms of different methodologies are analysed and compared. We also discuss their performance, advantages, disadvantages and potential for improvement. Methodology wise, a shift of popularity from meta-heuristic to mathematical optimisation is observed in recent years. Another observation is that more researchers are opting for XHSTT formatted datasets as a testbed for their algorithms. Finally, we outline the industrial perspective, trends and future direction in high school timetabling optimisation problems.},
